Suggetions:
1) we can add some more good music in the videos
2) breaking down the things:
-Resizing or padding the videos for making it mobile fit/youtube fit/ Instagram fit(portrait mode)
-Currently video is making only one rotation, so we can increase rotation and vary speed.
-music should be added at the end of video completion else audio will also have varying speed.

3) Do we prefer changing the background of the video?
